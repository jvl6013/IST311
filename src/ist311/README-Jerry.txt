So I uploaded my UI file. Some things to note, 

  1. our authentication methods are a little different. Im going to need your 
  Help to connect the methods since I do not know the buffer command You called.
  
  2. I put in a requestNavCntl method that is getting errors. Do we need a navigationtCntl class?
  
  3. You make Control Ctrl and I make Control Cntl in variables. I just realized this and am
  going back into my code to match yours, but if you get random errors on such variables
  it is probably our naming conventions.
